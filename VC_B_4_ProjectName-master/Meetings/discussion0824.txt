Description :
Fantasy Defense is a tower defense game. You can either play against an IA, but where the 
real fun comes at is when you duel your friends! You and your friend each take the role of
attacker (and defender !). 
A player can also create his own maps. They can put their maps online and then you can vote if
its a good attacking map/defending map. 
Adminstritator can kick players/moderator. 


Players will be either attack or defense. Map editing is an entire different game mode. 
You play online real time so both player have to be on their phone at the same time. 
Map is grid based. (2D array of cells and subcells). The environment can be allowing construction or not. 


6. 
- GUI
- Android based
- Multiplayer (server) 
- Map editing -> database to hold the maps
- Complex game mechanics
